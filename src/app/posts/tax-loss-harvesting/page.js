                As an investor, you're always seeking ways to maximize your returns while minimizing your tax burden.
                One strategy that can be particularly effective in reducing your taxable income is called tax loss
                harvesting. This involves selling investments at a loss and then repurchasing them shortly afterward.
                While this may seem counterintuitive, it's a legal and legitimate strategy that can significantly reduce
                your tax bill.

                <h4>How Tax Loss Harvesting Works</h4>

                <br />
                <p>
                    The core concept of tax loss harvesting is to offset capital gains with capital losses. Capital
                    gains arise when you sell an investment for more than you paid for it, while capital losses occur
                    when you sell an investment for less than you paid for it. By utilizing capital losses, you can
                    effectively reduce your taxable income.

                <h4>Timing is Key: Selling at Year-End</h4>

                <p>
                    To maximize the benefits of tax loss harvesting, timing is crucial. By selling investments at the
                    end of the tax year, you can effectively lock in those losses and carry them over to the next year.
                    This allows you to offset capital gains earned in the following year, thereby reducing your overall
                    tax liability.

                    <br /><br />

                    After selling an investment at a loss, you'll typically want to repurchase it again to maintain your
                    investment position. However, it's important to avoid triggering the wash sale rule, which disallows
                    you from claiming the tax loss if you repurchase the same or substantially identical investment
                    within 30 days of the sale. To avoid the wash sale rule, you can either wait 31 days after selling
                    the investment before repurchasing it or purchase a similar but not identical investment.
